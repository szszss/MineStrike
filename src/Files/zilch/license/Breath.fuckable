"In 2046 A.D of that world, ¡öpple Inc. submitted an application for an international patent for breath. Since that time, every living who can breath in the world has to pay to ¡öpple Inc. Most countries have paid for their citizens and beings, but some poor countries couldn't pay enought tax, and then, their citizens had to pay for lifes of theirs and their pets'. If they didn't, they will be executed by hanging, carried out by local law forces or U.N. Force.
After the patent became effective 4 years, 2 thousand million people and megas of animals had been killed. ¡öpple Inc. had become the richest corporation in the blue gem, being richer than the second one 4 times. However, ¡öamsung Co. submitted an application for an international patent for blink in 2050 A.D. From then on millions of people went blind since they couldn't pay for their eyes. And then, in 2051, ¡öoogle Inc. got the patent of thinking. In 2053, Force Open Source Organization applied the patent of hand, and in next year, L¡önux Profit Union applied a patent of walking. Billions of people lost their hands,legs,or brains... Ah, by the way, myself of that world tried to apply a patent for fantasying... What the hell her thought...
However, the balance was broke in 2055. ¡öicrosoft submitted an application for the patent of 'applying patent'. Other companies were enraged by ¡öicrosoft's action, and they threw the world into chaos. The blue gem was becoming grey,red,and...black,in the end. When I return to that world in 2059 of it's timeline, the Earth had become a black reeky carbon ball. Neither the human civilization nor Gensokyo survived, and the moon had been split to thousands by unknown cause.
Although it isn't the most miserable one, but it's the most stupid parallel world I have seen."
